# tsvsheet.go

> **A spreadsheet for plain text.** The Go implementation of [tsvsheet](https://github.com/uplang/tsvsheet): a `.tsvt` **is** the spreadsheet — a single TAB-separated grid whose cells are literal values or `=formulas` that address other cells in A1 notation (`B2`, `D2:D5`), computed in place — editable from the CLI, the browser, or the terminal, all through one engine.

This is the CLI/library implementation repo (module `github.com/uplang/tsvsheet.go`, binary `cmd/tsvsheet/`). It lifts the grammar repo's ANTLR-generated Go parser and reuses only its **expression sublanguage** (via `tsvt.ParseFormula`) to compile each cell's formula; the surrounding **A1 single-file spreadsheet model is layered here**.

> **Model pivot (in progress).** The repo was reoriented from the salvaged 2011 two-file worksheet (a `.tsvt` template of `=header`/`=body`/`=final` sections over a companion `.tsv` grid) to the single-file A1 spreadsheet above. The engine, session, all commands, the browser editor, and the TUI now implement the A1 model. The **grammar and the [specs/](../specs/) capability docs/ADRs still describe the two-file worksheet** — folding the A1 redefinition back into `SPECIFICATION.md` (grammar repo) and these specs is a deliberate later step. Until then, prefer this file and the shipped code over the two-file specs where they disagree. Two known consequences of the pivot: the grammar's full §5 reference algebra and worksheet parser (`tsvt.Parse`, `internal/tsvt/build.go`) are retained as the covered grammar seam but unused by the app (pruned at the fold-back); and a quoted string in a formula (`"Pass"`) still parses as a named-column reference and resolves to `#REF!` — text-valued formulas are a known gap.

## Architecture — one engine, three frontends

Every frontend consumes the same engine; none re-implements parsing or evaluation ([ADR 0002](../specs/decisions/0002-one-engine-thin-clients.md)).

- `src/grammar/tsvsheet` — the committed ANTLR-generated parser (package `tsvsheetgrammar`, `// Code generated … DO NOT EDIT`). Regenerate with `make go` in the grammar repo and copy `gen/go/*.go` here; excluded from the gates via [Makefile.local](../Makefile.local).
- `internal/tsvt` — the covered seam over the generated parser: source → immutable typed AST, or `constants.ErrSyntax`. No ANTLR type escapes this package.
- `internal/sheet` — the A1 spreadsheet engine: grid I/O, A1 reference resolution, the §11 expression evaluator with error values (`#REF!`/`#DIV/0!`/`#CIRC!`), dependency-ordered memoized `Compute`, immutable `Set`, `Check` diagnostics, `Explain` traces.
- `internal/session` — the one mutable editing model (the repo's sole pointer-receiver type), backing serve and tui.
- `internal/cli` — urfave/cli v3 commands: `render` `parse` `check` `explain` `serve` `tui`, unix stdin/stdout discipline.
- `internal/serve` — HTTP JSON API + embedded browser spreadsheet (`go:embed`, thin client of the session).
- `internal/tui` — bubbletea terminal editor over the same session.

## Non-negotiables

- **The engine is the single source of truth for semantics.** A new capability the web or TUI needs is added to `internal/session`/`internal/sheet` and consumed by both — never duplicated in a frontend. The ANTLR JavaScript target is deliberately unused (ADR 0002).
- **`[open]` SPECIFICATION items are decisions, not inventions.** Anything the 2011 source underspecified is pinned in [ADR 0003](../specs/decisions/0003-open-semantics.md) with a rationale; the §8 worked example is documented as internally inconsistent and is **not** a conformance target. New semantic choices extend that ADR.
- **The full gomatic Go gate applies:** `make check` green — gofumpt, vet, staticcheck, golangci (gocognit ≤ 7), govulncheck, **100% aggregate coverage** (every package, including `cmd/`; `src/grammar` excluded). Errors are `errs.Const` sentinels in `internal/constants`; no `fmt.Errorf`/`errors.New`. Value receivers except `session.Session`.
