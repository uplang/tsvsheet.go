	description = `Rewrite every template-identity token to a new project name.

Intended to be run once, immediately after cloning this template into a new
repository. The Go module path is taken from the git origin remote (because Go
requires the module path to be the repository), and every reference to the old
module path, command name, environment prefix, and package identifier is
rewritten across the tracked files; the cmd/<old> directory is moved to
cmd/<new>.

The optional [name] sets only the command/binary name (cmd/<name>); when omitted
it defaults to the repository name from the remote. The module path always
follows the remote regardless of [name].

Examples:
  tsvsheet rename
  tsvsheet rename mytool
  tsvsheet rename --dry-run

The --dry-run flag reports which files would change without writing or moving
anything.`
